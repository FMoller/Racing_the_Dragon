# Racing_the_Dragon
 The purpose of this repo is to serve as a practice and consequently store source codes aimed at optimized programming. The name was based in part on the title of a youtuber video whose channel is called Creel, in which he, via assembly, tries and manages to get a code for Collatz's conjecture faster than a C code compiled by optimized compilers.
